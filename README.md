## Work Experience
**Fullstack Web Developer @ K√≥ryos (_June 2022 - Present_)**
- Managed website development from planning to deployment
- Used **HTML, CSS, and Javascript** to develop the front end and **Spring, Django, Java, SQL, and Python** for the back end. I also used WordPress and Elementor on some projects.
- Designed and coded responsive, user-friendly interfaces, maintained and optimized websites, ensuring functionality, performance, and database security.
- Here are some websites I have developed: [UrgentLondonDoctors](https://uld.london), [KuwaitOilTrading](https://highproof-kw.com/), [ConsultationCA](https://dallata.ca) 

**AI Researcher @ University of Birmingham (_April 2022 - April 2024_)**
- Conducted data collection, processing, and analysis for a novel study evaluating the impact of COVID-19 on aviation companies.
- Applied unsupervised deep learning approaches to tweets about the top 10 busiest airports to uncover hidden insights

## Projects
### Automated the analysis of Patient Experience for the NHS using data analysis and machine learning(Natural Language Processing)
[Publication](https://kavishmuthoora.notion.site/Data-analysis-of-NHS-patient-reviews-using-Artificial-Intelligence-f080c0a68b8d482cb041b481b5345134)

Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.

### Developed a Java multiplayer Prop-Hunt (hide-and-seek) PC game

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models that estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.

### Built a LegoEV3 Mindstorm robot capable of exploring a maze and simultaneously mapping it while avoiding obstacles and able to return to its starting position calculating the shortest path possible.
